title: How to run the site locally
---

## Prerequisites

1. Install Ruby 3.1.4

   The version is pinned in `.ruby-version`. Newer Rubies will not work — the
   `github-pages` gem chain expects 3.1.x.

   ```bash
   rbenv install 3.1.4
   ```

2. Make sure rbenv is active in your shell

   This is the most common setup problem. `rbenv init` writes to `~/.zprofile`,
   which zsh only loads for **login** shells — so an integrated terminal in your
   editor can silently fall back to system or Homebrew Ruby. Put the init line in
   `~/.zshrc` instead, so it loads in every interactive shell:

   ```bash
   echo 'eval "$(rbenv init - zsh)"' >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

   If you append that line with `>>`, check that it landed on its own line —
   if your `~/.zshrc` had no trailing newline it will be glued onto the previous
   line and silently do nothing.

   Open a new terminal and verify from inside the project directory:

   ```bash
   ruby -v      # must print 3.1.4 — not 3.4, not 4.x
   which ruby   # must be a path under ~/.rbenv/shims
   ```

   If `which ruby` points at `/opt/homebrew/bin/ruby` or `/usr/bin/ruby`, stop
   here and fix it. Every step below will fail in confusing ways otherwise.

3. Install Bundler 2.x

   ```bash
   gem install bundler -v '~> 2.3'
   ```

   Do **not** run a bare `gem install bundler`. That installs Bundler 4.x, which
   requires Ruby >= 3.2 and cannot run on this project's Ruby.

   You do not need to install Jekyll separately — it comes from the
   `github-pages` gem, which pins it to the version GitHub Pages actually runs.

4. Install Node.js and yarn

   Node 22 LTS is known good.

   ```bash
   npm install --global yarn
   ```

## Setup

Install project dependencies:

```bash
bundle install    # Install Ruby dependencies
yarn install      # Install Node.js dependencies
```

## Run the site locally

```bash
bundle install     # Ruby deps (once)
yarn install       # Node deps (once)
yarn start         # then open http://localhost:4000
```

`yarn start` does five things in order:

1. **Clears `_site` and `.jekyll-metadata`** so the run cannot inherit stale
   output. See "Why `start` cleans first" below — this is not paranoia, it is
   the fix for a specific way the dev server lies to you.
2. **Creates `test-results/` and `playwright-report/`** (`dev:watchdirs`). They
   are in `_config.yml`'s `exclude`, but that alone does not stop the watcher —
   see "Why the empty directories" below.
3. **Splits the NoBlogs data** (`scripts/split-noblogs-data.mjs`). `/noblogs`
   fetches `data.index.json` and `data.detail.json`, which are generated from
   `data.json` and gitignored. Skip this and `/noblogs` 404s both files.
4. **Builds the CSS once, then watches it.** Jekyll does not run PostCSS, so
   without this the Tailwind stylesheet never rebuilds as you edit. The watcher
   is the Tailwind CLI, not `postcss --watch` — see "Why the Tailwind CLI
   watches the CSS" below.
5. **Serves the site to `_site`.** No livereload — refresh by hand; see
   "Why there is no `--livereload`" below for what it was costing.

Running a piece on its own:

| | |
|---|---|
| `npm run clean` | drop `_site` and `.jekyll-metadata` |
| `npm run dev:watchdirs` | create the directories the watcher must ignore |
| `npm run data:split` | regenerate the NoBlogs index/detail files |
| `npm run watch:css` | Tailwind watcher only |
| `npm run build:css` | one-shot CSS build (do NOT run while the watcher is up) |
| `npm run jekyll:serve` | server only (assumes the above have run) |
| `npm run build` | one-shot production build into `_site/` |
| `npm run serve:build` | serve what `npm run build` produced |

### Why `start` cleans first

The server runs `--incremental`, which is what keeps edits fast. It also has one
sharp edge that cost an afternoon, and `npm run clean` is the guard against it.

Incremental mode decides a page is up to date by comparing the source file's
mtime against the output already sitting in `_site`. It tracks layouts and
includes as dependencies. It does **not** track `_config.yml` as a dependency of
anything. So:

1. Edit `_config.yml` while the server is running. The server has the old config
   cached in memory — it never re-reads the file — but it *does* pick layout and
   include edits up off disk. It writes pages that are half new, half old.
2. Restart the server. It now reads the new config correctly, compares mtimes,
   finds every output file newer than its source, decides there is nothing to do,
   and serves you the wrong HTML it wrote in step 1.

Nothing warns you. The page looks stale in a way that reads like your change did
not work, and restarting — the obvious move — cannot fix it, because the restart
is what skips the rebuild. The symptom that gave it away: `<body class="">` on
every page after a `defaults:` change, for hours.

Clearing `_site` and `.jekyll-metadata` on every `start` closes it — there is
nothing stale left to skip, so a restart always means what you think it means.

### Why there is no `--livereload`

Jekyll's own servlet drops your custom headers on everything except HTML when
livereload is on (`lib/jekyll/commands/serve/servlet.rb`):

```ruby
if @jekyll_opts["livereload"]
  return rtn if SkipAnalyzer.skip_processing?(req, res, @jekyll_opts)  # CSS exits here
  ...
end
res.header.merge!(@headers)   # never reached for static assets
```

`skip_processing?` short-circuits for non-HTML, so `styles.css` went out with
only `ETag` and `Last-Modified` and no `Cache-Control`. Browsers then apply
heuristic caching and reuse the stylesheet without revalidating.

That compounds with something incremental builds do: **a CSS-only change
regenerates no HTML at all.** `assets/css/styles.css` is a static file, not a
page dependency, so every page keeps the `?v={{ site.time }}` token it was
built with. The browser re-requests a URL it already has, and nothing tells it
to revalidate. Net effect: you edit CSS, the file on disk is correct, the
server is serving it, and the browser shows you the old one — for as long as
the heuristic lasts.

Without `--livereload` the header reaches every response, so nothing the dev
server sends is cacheable and a plain refresh is always current. The cost is
that the page no longer reloads by itself. If you put the flag back, expect the
CSS-caching behavior back with it.

Dropping `--incremental` instead was tried and reverted. Full rebuilds of this
repo are not the five seconds a cold `jekyll build` suggests; under the watcher
they measured 7s, 21s and 63s, because every pass recopies the two NoBlogs JSON
payloads (~18 MB). If you run `npm run jekyll:serve` on its own, you are
bypassing the clean — run `npm run clean` first if you have touched the config.

### Why the Tailwind CLI watches the CSS

`watch:css` used to be `postcss assets/css/main.css -o ... --watch`. PostCSS
watches the input stylesheet and its CSS imports. It does **not** watch the
files Tailwind scans for class names. So adding a utility class in an HTML file
generated nothing: the markup had `hover:bg-black/[0.06]`, no such rule was ever
emitted, and the style silently did nothing while everything looked correct.

The Tailwind CLI watches the `content` globs, so a class added in any HTML file
rebuilds the stylesheet (measured: under 5 seconds). Two details matter:

- **`--watch=always`, not `--watch`.** Tailwind's watch mode exits when stdin is
  not a TTY, which is exactly how `run-p` starts it. With plain `--watch` the
  process disappeared without an error and the CSS silently stopped rebuilding.
- **`--postcss postcss.config.js`** keeps autoprefixer in the chain. Output was
  verified byte-identical to the old PostCSS build after normalizing whitespace,
  so dev and production CSS do not diverge.

Two things to know while it is running:

- **Do not run `npm run build:css`.** Two processes then write
  `assets/css/styles.css` at once and a request can catch it mid-write.
- **Watch rebuilds add classes but do not prune removed ones.** A class you
  delete leaves its rule behind until a full build. `yarn start` runs
  `build:css` fresh before the watcher, so restarting clears it, and `npm run
  build` is always clean — stale rules never ship.

### Tailwind cannot see a class glued to a Liquid tag

Tailwind scans raw file text. A class written immediately after a closing Liquid
tag, with no space between them, is swallowed into a single candidate along with
that tag, matches no utility, and is never generated.

Assign the classes to a variable first and interpolate that, so every class sits
inside a quoted string where a quote or a space delimits it. `_includes/nav.html`
does this for its current/hover state classes. The failure is silent — the page
renders, the class is in the HTML, and no rule exists.

### Why the empty directories

Anything written inside the repo while the server runs triggers a rebuild, and
pages 404 for the second or two it takes. Jekyll does not read `.gitignore`, and
its watcher does not skip dot-directories, so `.gstack/` and Playwright's
`test-results/` are both in `_config.yml`'s `exclude`.

For `test-results/` the exclude is necessary but not sufficient. Jekyll's watcher
builds its ignore list with `next unless absolute_path.exist?` — **an excluded
path that does not exist when the server boots is watched anyway.** Playwright
creates the directory on its first run, which is after boot, so it was watched
and every test write rebuilt the site.

That turned one failing test into a cascade: the failure wrote `error-context.md`,
the write triggered a rebuild, the rebuild 404'd the next page under test, that
test failed and wrote another file. It presented as a dozen unrelated flaky
specs, and it got *worse* with `--workers=1` because retries write more. The
suite went from 2 failed / 10 flaky in 1.5 minutes to 68 passed in 35 seconds
once the directories existed at boot.

So `start` mkdirs them. They are empty and gitignored; do not delete them while
the server is running.

**The dev server no longer touches `docs/`.** It used to write there — that is
what the old "run `git restore docs/` before you commit" warning was about — and
it now builds to `_site` like everything else. If you ever see `docs/` dirty in
`git status`, something ran a bare `jekyll build`/`jekyll serve` without
`--destination`; recover with:

```bash
git checkout -- docs/ && git clean -fd docs/
```

> `_config.yml` still says `destination: docs` and that is deliberate — Jekyll
> excludes whatever that names from the *source scan*, which is what keeps the
> 445 MB committed tree from being read as source. The `--destination _site` on
> the command line is what decides where output actually goes. Changing the
> config value instead makes a build start rewriting `docs/`. It goes away when
> `docs/` does.

## Promoting to production

**Merge to `master` and it deploys.** Coolify builds the site from source with
this repo's `Dockerfile` and serves `_site` from `nginx:alpine`. There is no
manual build step and nothing to commit into `docs/`.

`datarepublican.com` sits behind Cloudflare; the origin is Coolify, app
`qw4koc0gkcwgs8wwckkcc8cc`, tracking `master`. Pull requests get a preview at
`pr-<PR#>.datarepublican-site.americancloud.dev`.

`.github/workflows/ci.yml` runs the build plus the full test suite on every pull
request. Two of its gates matter more than the rest:

- **The route contract.** `tests/routes.txt` lists every published URL, and a
  build that drops one fails. Removing a page deliberately means editing that
  file in the same commit, so the deletion shows up in review. This gate is what
  caught `/tests/` disappearing when `tests` was added to `_config.yml`'s
  exclude — and note that the route step *gates* Playwright, so a red route
  check means the suite did not run at all rather than that it passed.
- **Build size.** The build is ~462 MB. Watch it: `docs/` still ships alongside
  it in the repo.

### After a deploy, verify by content — not by status code

```bash
scripts/verify-deploy.sh https://datarepublican.com <git-ref>
```

`datarepublican.com` returns **200 for any path**, including ones that do not
exist — `try_files $uri $uri/ /index.html` answers a missing asset with the home
page. So "it returns 200" proves nothing, and a missing script reports
`Unexpected token '<'` rather than a 404.

The script checks the route contract, every referenced asset's content-type,
gzip, `og.png` byte-for-byte against the ref, and that the v2 chrome is present.
Its header documents the two other traps it works around: `url:` in
`_config.yml` is always the production domain, so SEO tags point at production
from every environment; and the old `/ea-explorer/*.html` paths are redirect
stubs that do the same.

### `docs/` — still load-bearing, for two other things

It is no longer what `datarepublican.com` serves, but do not delete it yet:

- **GitHub Pages still builds from it.** `build_type: legacy`, source
  `{branch: master, path: /docs}`. That is a second publisher at
  `datarepublican.github.io/datarepublican/`, and it shows the pre-cutover site
  because `docs/` has not been regenerated since Aug 31.
- **It is the rollback.** Setting the Coolify app back to `build_pack: static`
  and `base_directory: /docs` restores the old site in one API call.

Deleting it is a deliberate follow-up: decide what Pages is for, then
`git rm -r docs/`, set `_config.yml`'s `destination` to `_site`, and drop `docs`
from `exclude`. That also retires the trap where a bare `jekyll build` — one
without `--destination` — overwrites production's artifact.

`.github/workflows/deploy.yml` was **not** merged, on purpose. See "Deploying"
in `CLAUDE.md`.

## What is generated, and when to regenerate it

Most of the site is committed source. Four things are not, and two of them need
a manual run after the data pipeline drops new files in.

**Generated on every build — never commit these:**

| | |
|---|---|
| `_site/` | the built site |
| `noblogs/data.index.json`, `noblogs/data.detail.json` | split from `data.json` |
| `assets/css/styles.css` | Tailwind output (committed today, regenerated by the build) |

**Generated by hand, and committed** — re-run after the pipeline drops new
artifacts, or the site keeps showing the old ones:

```bash
node scripts/extract-logo-blobs.mjs   # after new *.embed.js logo blobs land
node scripts/capture-previews.mjs     # home page card images (needs a running server)
```

`extract-logo-blobs.mjs` turns `dsa-explorer/logos/*.embed.js` and
`noblogs/graph/logos.embed.js` — base64 PNG loaded as blocking scripts — into
image files plus a small manifest. Base64 does not compress, so those were 21 MB
and 12.6 MB *on the wire*. The `.embed.js` files stay in the repo as the
pipeline's artifacts and are excluded from the build in `_config.yml`.

### The data pipeline's side of the contract

The heavy datasets are built elsewhere and dropped into this repo. **Nothing
about that changes.** `noblogs/data.json` in particular is consumed exactly as
delivered — the split happens here, at build time, so there is no chunking
convention for the pipeline to honour. If `data.json` grows a field, it lands in
the index untouched and the build still passes.

Two gates run on every build and will stop it rather than ship bad data:

- **Redaction.** 291 doxxing-flagged blogs must carry no link fields; baselines
  are pinned at 291 blogs / 1,926 news entries / 515 quotes, all at zero links.
- **Reconstruction.** `data.index.json` + `data.detail.json` must reassemble
  `data.json` exactly.

## Housekeeping

`git status` should be clean after a dev session. If it is not:

| you see | what it is | what to do |
|---|---|---|
| `docs/` modified or deleted | something ran a build without `--destination` | `git checkout -- docs/ && git clean -fd docs/` |
| `_site/`, `test-results/`, `playwright-report/`, `.jekyll-metadata` | build and test output | gitignored; delete freely |
| `noblogs/data.index.json` / `data.detail.json` | the split output | gitignored; regenerate with `npm run data:split` |
| `assets/css/styles.css` modified | Tailwind rebuilt it | commit it if you changed CSS, otherwise `git checkout --` it |

Before opening a PR:

```bash
npm run build                                   # must be warning-free
python3 -m http.server 4000 --directory _site &  # a plain static server
npm run test:routes                             # all 34 routes resolve
npm test                                        # Playwright
git status                                      # clean, and no docs/ changes
```

## Testing

Serve the build with a **plain static server**. `npx serve` is not equivalent:
it rewrites `/officers/index.html` to `/officers`, dropping the trailing slash,
so relative script tags resolve against `/` and the page 404s its own
dependencies. GitHub Pages keeps the trailing slash.

The suite covers the usual page-loads-and-has-a-title checks, plus:

- **Mobile reachability** (`test_dsa_explorer_mobile`, `test_noblogs_mobile`) —
  controls present, &ge;44px, and *not occluded* at 390px. A tool can load fine
  and return correct data while being unusable with a thumb.
- **The tools index** (`test_tools_index`) — every entry in `_data/tools.yml`
  resolves, and each sort actually reorders. Read by *visual* order, since the
  sorting is CSS `order` and DOM order would pass regardless.
- **Payload regressions** — no `*.embed.js` logo blob is loaded,
  `quotes.embed.js` is fetched once rather than twice, `/noblogs` paints from
  the index without fetching `data.json`.
- **Controls that a refactor can silently kill** (`test_review_regressions`) —
  a selector left pointing at a renamed element leaves the page rendering
  perfectly with a dead control, which nothing else here would catch.

Use real clicks in new specs, not dispatched `MouseEvent`s. A synthetic event
goes straight to its target and cannot be intercepted, so it passes happily
while an invisible overlay eats every tap a real thumb makes.

## How the site is put together

- **Chrome** — `_layouts/default.html` is banner &rarr; masthead &rarr; nav
  &rarr; content &rarr; footer. One DOM order for both layouts, and one masthead
  for every page — home and internal pages render the same wordmark, rule and
  tagline. The nav pill is `fixed` at the bottom on a phone and `sticky` near
  the top at `md`; it is a sibling of `<header>`, not a child, because a sticky
  element can only travel inside its parent's box. `_data/banner.yml` drives the
  site-wide band; `enabled: false` removes it everywhere.
- **One shell, many reading measures** — every page uses the same
  `.page-column` (1600px, `--column-max` on `:root`), so the banner, masthead,
  rule and nav never change size between the tools index, a tool and a
  narrative page. That includes the chrome above and below the content: the
  announcement band and the footer take `.page-column` too, so nothing runs
  edge to edge past a centered masthead on a wide window. The only things wider
  than the shell are `position: fixed` overlays, which are meant to cover the
  viewport. There is deliberately no per-page width setting: a `width`
  front-matter key used to switch the shell between the full width and 1024px,
  and the
  chrome visibly shrank when you navigated from Tools to About.
  A narrow column is a property of the CONTENT that needs one — `.text-column`
  (832px) on `/about/` and `/donate/`, `.prose max-w-column` in the markdown
  layout. Anything else inside a narrative page that should line up with the
  text, like the About quote, takes `max-w-prose` — the same token
  `.text-column` is built from, so the two cannot drift.
- **The masthead rule** — 5px bar, 3px gap, 2px bar. It is one element whose
  `height` is the 10px total, because preflight sets `box-sizing: border-box`
  and the two bars are borders drawn inside that height. Asking for the 3px gap
  as the height collapses it into one solid 7px bar.
- **Tools must not style bare `header`** — the site masthead is a `<header>`,
  and it precedes the tool's own in the DOM. `noblogs` and `dsa-explorer` both
  styled the bare element: `display:flex` turned the masthead into a flex
  container, which shrank the wordmark block to its content width and cut the
  rule short, and noblogs made the masthead sticky at `z-index: 600` as well.
  Its JS had the matching bug — `querySelector('header')` returned the masthead,
  so `--nb-header-h` measured the wrong element and every offset built on it
  (facet rail, scrim, drawer, both canvases) was wrong. Both tools now scope to
  `#nb-header` / `#dsa-header`; `test_review_regressions.spec.js` guards it.
- **The tools index** — `/` is the tools page, which is why the nav has no Home
  item. `_data/tools.yml` is the single source of truth for all thirteen tools.
  `updated` is the last commit touching that tool's directory, so the default
  "Latest" sort means something; keep it honest.
- **Nav sizing** — the 16px label is the anchor and the pill is sized in `em`
  from it, so the chrome follows the type instead of drifting from it. The 44px
  minimum tap target applies on phones only, where the pill *is* the navigation;
  above `md` the compact pill applies.
- **Bottom sheets** — `assets/js/sheet.js`. On a phone, a tool's detail panel
  becomes a sheet over the canvas instead of a column 700px below the fold. At
  &ge;768px it is `display: contents` and the panel is an ordinary side column.
  Its styles live *outside* `@layer components` in `assets/css/main.css`,
  because Tailwind purges layer CSS whose classes never appear in any HTML —
  and every class there is created at runtime.

## Troubleshooting

**`jekyll: command not found`**

1. Confirm `ruby -v` prints 3.1.4 — see Prerequisites step 2
2. Confirm `gem list bundler` includes a 2.x version
3. Run `bundle install`
4. Run Jekyll through Bundler: `bundle exec jekyll ...`, never bare `jekyll`

**`cannot load such file -- rexml/parsers/baseparser`**

You are on the wrong Ruby. Ruby 3.4 dropped `rexml` from the default gems, and
the old kramdown in this dependency tree can't load it. The giveaway is the gem
path in the traceback — if it reads `/opt/homebrew/lib/ruby/gems/4.0.0/`, that's
Homebrew's Ruby, not rbenv's. Fix Prerequisites step 2, then delete and
regenerate `Gemfile.lock` (see below) — the failed run will have rewritten it
with incompatible pins.

**`Could not find github-pages-87, jekyll-3.1.6, ... (Bundler::GemNotFound)`**
**or `Unable to satisfy the following requirements: bundler (= 4.x)`**

Your `Gemfile.lock` was generated by a different Ruby. It is gitignored, so it
is safe to delete and regenerate:

```bash
rm Gemfile.lock
bundle install
```

**`undefined method 'request' for nil:NilClass` during `bundle install`**

Bundler 4.x is installed in the Ruby 3.1.4 gemset. `bundle` always picks the
newest installed Bundler, but 4.x requires Ruby >= 3.2, so it fails before it
can do anything. Remove it from this gemset — it can't run here anyway:

```bash
gem uninstall bundler -v 4.0.20   # substitute whatever 4.x `gem list bundler` shows
bundle -v                         # should now report 2.3.x
```

If any of the above still fails, you are probably not on Ruby 3.1.4 — recheck
Prerequisites step 2.

**Dependency issues generally**

```bash
rbenv local 3.1.4
gem install bundler -v '~> 2.3'
rm Gemfile.lock
bundle install
```

**`cannot load such file -- webrick`**

`webrick` is already declared in the `Gemfile`, so this normally means
`bundle install` did not complete. Re-run it. Don't run `bundle add webrick` —
that edits the `Gemfile` to add a dependency that is already there.

**Build warning: `Layout 'nofooter' requested in browse/index.html does not exist`**

Fixed — `_layouts/nofooter.html` now exists, and the build is warning-free. If
this reappears, it is not harmless: Jekyll does not fall back to the default
layout, it renders the page with *no* layout at all. That is why
`https://datarepublican.com/browse/` shipped for years with no `<head>`, no
`<title>`, no nav and no SEO tags.
