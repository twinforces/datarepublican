"""
generate_state_reports.py — Per-state cluster reports + national heatmap index.

Uses Addresses.state (column) — not parsed from street text.

Flow:
  1. Count pass clusters per state (same thresholds as national reports).
  2. show_n(state) = min(100, max(1, pass_clusters // 10))  # ≤10%
  3. Emit national heatmap index + states/XX/index.html + detail pages.

Location slices:
  address  — cluster key = canonical_address, partitioned by Addresses.state
  zipcode  — cluster key = Addresses.zip_code (∈ Zips), partitioned by Addresses.state
  colocator / loose_colocator — cluster key as usual, partitioned by Addresses.state
    (rows missing state are dropped from by-state views)

Usage:
  python generate_state_reports.py --focus dot --slice-by address
  python generate_state_reports.py --focus medicare --slice-by zipcode --max-states 10
  python generate_state_reports.py --research-only
