#!/bin/bash
# loop_until_fast.sh
#
# Purpose: Runs a given command repeatedly (in a loop) until one full execution completes
# in less than 60 seconds, then exits cleanly. The entire process is wrapped in macOS
# `caffeinate` to prevent the machine from sleeping (idle or system sleep).
#
# This is useful for scripts whose runtime degrades as a database fills up (e.g., a
# batch processor that eventually finishes its current work quickly once the queue
# is empty or the DB state stabilizes).
#
# Usage:
#   ./loop_until_fast.sh your_command [arg1 arg2 ...]
#
# Example:
#   ./loop_until_fast.sh ./process_db.sh --input /data/db
#
# The script itself invokes caffeinate, so you do not need to prefix it.

# Constant for the threshold (easy to change later, follows DRY)
