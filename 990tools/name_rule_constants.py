name_rule_constants.py

Shared constants for the 990 name rules system.
This is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for:
- GENERIC_SINGLE_WORDS (blacklist for single-word canonicals)
- GOOD_SINGLE_WORD_PRIORITIES (exceptions that should NEVER appear in BAD SHORT CANONICALS)

Both generate_name_rules_v19.1.py and the analyze_*.py scripts import from here.
This guarantees that adding a new priority or expanding the generic blacklist
automatically updates every diagnostic report.

Edit this file when you want to:
- Add/remove generic single words (e.g. new noise patterns)
- Add new high-value single-word priorities (UNICEF, JOBSOHIO, KIPP, etc.)
