# The production and preview image. Nothing local needs Docker — `yarn start`
# is still the way to run the site on your machine. This exists so Coolify
# builds the site from source instead of serving a build artifact committed to
# the repo, and so previews and production are built the same way.
#
# Two stages: a Ruby+Node builder that runs the same `npm run build` used in CI,
# and an nginx image that carries only `_site`. The toolchain does not ship.

# gem chain expects 3.1.x and will not install on newer.

# Node is needed because Jekyll does not run PostCSS — the Tailwind stylesheet
# is built separately (see `npm run build:css`), and `npm run data:split`
# generates the two NoBlogs payloads that /noblogs fetches at runtime.

# Dependencies before source, so the expensive layers survive content changes.
# `bundle install` is the slow one — a Gemfile edit is rare, a content edit is
# not, and this is the difference between a two minute deploy and a ten
# minute one.
#
# Bundler is pinned: a bare `gem install bundler` installs 4.x, which requires
# Ruby >= 3.2 and cannot run here.
#
# Gemfile only — `Gemfile.lock` is in .gitignore and tracked by nothing, so it
# does not exist in a fresh clone and copying it fails the build outright
# ("/Gemfile.lock": not found). Every build therefore resolves gems from
# scratch, which is what CI has always done. What keeps that from drifting is
# the `github-pages` gem, which pins its whole transitive set to the versions
# GitHub Pages runs.
