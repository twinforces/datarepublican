# Tool chrome — the pattern

How a full-viewport tool arranges the controls around its canvas. Settled on
`noblogs` in September 2026 and drawn on the Paper boards
`trumpblogs 3/mobile` and `trumpblogs 3/desktop` (page `p-2-0`).

`dsa-explorer` and every tool built after this follows it. The adoption rule
still applies — migrate what you touched — but **a new tool has no excuse.**

---

## 1. One row per question, ordered by how often it is asked

A tool's chrome answers three questions, and each gets exactly one row:

| Row | Question | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | *What am I looking at?* | tool title, the live count, the legal link |
| 2 | *Which view?* | the view toggle |
| 3 | *Which subset?* | Filters, then search |

**Phone: three stacked rows, in that order.** Views above search, because you
switch view far more often than you type a query, and a thumb reaches the top
of the stack last.

**md and up: rows 2 and 3 become one row** — subset controls left, views right.
You narrow the data on the left and choose how to draw it on the right. That is
the conventional reading and it is what the boards settle.

Write the markup in the PHONE's order and use `order` to swap at md. The phone
is the layout that cannot absorb a compromise; desktop has room to be rearranged.

```css
.nb-toolbar{display:flex;flex-direction:column;gap:8px}
@media(min-width:768px){
  .nb-toolbar{flex-direction:row;align-items:center;justify-content:space-between}
  .nb-toolbar .tabs       {order:2;flex:none}
  .nb-toolbar .nb-controls{order:1;flex:0 1 auto}
}
```

### The header is a flex COLUMN, never flex-wrap

`noblogs` was one `flex-wrap` row holding five things. On a phone it wrapped
into five bands and the map started below the fold — and because the row count
was a function of viewport width *and* content length, the height had to be
measured at runtime and kept surprising us.

A fixed column of three rows has a predictable height. You still measure it
(see §6), but you are measuring one number that rarely changes rather than
tracking a reflow.

---

## 2. Nothing permanent sits on the canvas

The canvas is the product. Anything drawn on top of it is rent, and it has to
earn the space every time the tool is opened.

**Delete an overlay that duplicates a control you already have elsewhere.**
noblogs' `.info` card held a category legend that was a *second* category
filter, ANDed with the facet one — two controls for one question, and the
facet version already had counts and swatches. The card went; nothing was lost.

When you remove an overlay, every piece of it gets a home, and each move should
be a de-duplication rather than a relocation:

| Was | Went to |
|---|---|
| counts | the header's live status line (`#subcount`) — already announced to a screen reader |
| a display toggle | a group in the filter popover, behind a real API (§7) |
| a color legend | the facet group that already lists the same categories |

If something has no home, that is a signal the thing itself was not carrying
its weight.

**Check what the DESTINATION was already saying.** Redistribution is where you
overwrite, not where you drop, and the overwrite is silent. The status line had
been answering *how much of the corpus matched* — "107 of 7,673 blogs match" —
and when the map card was deleted, the pin count moved into that same line and
took it over: "34 of 107 mapped". Nothing was lost from the card; the
destination's own job was. It reads as a plausible sentence, the numbers are
all real, and it looks for all the world like a data regression to anyone
comparing against production.

So after every move, read the destination out loud in each state it can be in
— filtered and not, per view — and check it still answers what it answered
before. A fraction whose halves are equal ("7,673 of 7,673") is the other tell
that a line is being written by two features that have not been introduced.

### Corners belong to the vendor

Leaflet puts its zoom control at **top-left**. Cytoscape's fit/zoom conventions
are the same corner. An overlay pinned there covers the one control every user
reaches for first. noblogs' card did exactly that, at every width.

Before you pin anything to a canvas corner, open the tool and look at what the
vendor already drew there.

A **transient** popover may overlap a vendor control — you opened it, it closes
on scrim tap, and you are not zooming while you filter. **Permanent** chrome may
not.

---

## 2a. The detail panel is a column of the canvas, not a drawer over the page

Two tools drawing the same picture — a canvas plus a detail for whatever is
selected — solved it two different ways. dsa-explorer had a persistent sidebar
in its stage grid. noblogs had a full-viewport drawer that flew in from the
right over a scrim, so picking a pin dimmed the map you picked it from and the
map you were reading against was behind a wash.

**The sidebar is the pattern.** A canvas view gets a second grid column, the
panel lives in it, and the canvas is simply narrower:

```css
body[data-view="map"] #nb-stage { display: grid; grid-template-columns: minmax(0,1fr) var(--nb-side, 21rem) }
body[data-view="map"] #panel    { position: static; transform: none; box-shadow: none; overflow: hidden }
body[data-view="map"] #scrim    { display: none }
```

Four things follow from it:

- **The column is always there, so the canvas width is constant.** Nothing has
  to re-measure Leaflet or re-fit Cytoscape on open and close — the bug class
  goes away rather than getting a handler.
- **It is never empty.** Default content when nothing is selected (on noblogs,
  the categories, which double as the map's color key), the detail when
  something is, one swapped for the other by a class on `body`. A panel that
  is blank half the time reads as a rendering failure.
- **The close button only exists while there is somewhere to go back to.** It
  returns you to the default content; without a selection it has no meaning.
- **The scrim goes.** A scrim is for something modal, and a column is not.
- **The panel clips; a child inside it scrolls.** `overflow: hidden` above is
  deliberate — the panel is a fixed-height flex column clipped to the band's
  rounded corner, and noblogs' `#pinner` and `#nb-side-cats` each carry their
  own `overflow-y: auto`. Do not move the scrolling back up to `#panel` here:
  below md that same element becomes `.dr-sheet__body` and has to be the only
  scroller. Desktop clips and delegates; mobile scrolls itself. §3b.

**A view with no canvas keeps the overlay.** noblogs' List view already spends
a column on the facet rail, and measuring showed a third drops the card grid
from four columns to two. Below md both forms become the same bottom sheet.

`openModal` / `closeModal` do not know any of this. They set the selection and
toggle a class; the placement is CSS keyed on `body[data-view]`. If the
placement rules reach into the open/close path, you have two mechanisms.

**The band is a closed box**: a 1px rule all the way around, `--dr-radius-lg`
on its outer corners, and `overflow: hidden`. That last part is what makes the
corners real — Leaflet's tiles and Cytoscape's canvas are opaque children that
square them off otherwise.

**The header draws no rule above it.** Both tools had a `border-bottom` on the
tool header, which runs the page's full width and cuts straight across the
corner the radius has just drawn. One box's edge, not two lines meeting at a
tangent. A view with no band — noblogs' List — keeps the header rule, because
there is nothing else there to separate it from.

Where the tool has a wrapper around the whole band (noblogs' `#nb-stage`) one
rule does it. Where the canvas and the panel are separate grid children
(dsa-explorer, whose header shares the grid so there is nothing to wrap) the
box is drawn in halves: each takes the border and the two corners on its own
side, and the seam between them is the panel's `border-left`. `position: fixed`
chrome — the overlay drawer, the phone sheet — is not clipped by any of this:
its containing block is the viewport.

### Drawing one control in two places

Categories render in the sidebar *and* in the filter popover. That looks like
duplication and the first cut removed the popover's copy — which broke the
thing the sidebar was for: once a blog is selected the detail takes the column
over, and there was then no way to recolor the map while reading one.

Two presentations of one control is fine. **Neither may hold state.** Render
both out of the single source on every change, from the same function, and bind
them with the same binder:

```js
el.innerHTML   = groups();          // the popover
side.innerHTML = grp("Category", "cat", …);   // the sidebar
bindFacets(el); bindFacets(side);
```

They cannot drift because there is nothing to drift — there is one `F`, and
both are output. The trap is the *other* direction: anything that reads the DOM
back now has two answers to choose from. Restoring focus after a rebuild broke
on exactly this, because `document.querySelector` returns the first match in
document order, which was the copy inside the closed popover — `display:none`,
where `focus()` is a silent no-op. Capture **which container** held focus, not
only which row.

---

## 3. Legal text is a modal, not a band

The disclaimer was a full-width amber callout pinned under the header. Its
resting state was the word "Disclaimer" and a triangle — a permanent row of a
390px screen, on every view, for a notice that is read once if ever.

It is now a `.dr-dialog-open` link in the identity row that opens a
`.dr-dialog`. The text is unchanged and still one keystroke away.

**Use a native `<dialog>` with `showModal()`.** Not `show()`, and not a
hand-rolled overlay. See `assets/css/components/dialog.css` for the full list of
what the platform hands over, but the one that matters most here:

> **The top layer.** A modal dialog renders above every stacking context
> regardless of z-index. Leaflet numbers its panes to 1000 and the repo's rule
> is that nothing it authors goes above 100 — the top layer is how a modal
> clears a vendored z-index without joining the bidding war.

`.dr-dialog` is **not** a replacement for `DRSheet` and must not become one. The
sheet is a persistent, draggable, detented *view of a selection* that coexists
with the canvas. A dialog is a modal interruption you dismiss. The phone styling
makes the dialog look like a sheet because bottom-anchored is right for a thumb,
not because they are interchangeable.

---

## 3a. One bottom-sheet motion, and every sliding surface uses it

**There is exactly one "arrives from an edge" motion on this site:**

```css
transition: transform var(--dr-dur-sheet) var(--dr-ease-sheet);   /* 240ms, cubic-bezier(.32,.72,0,1) */
```

`.dr-sheet` and `.dr-dialog` are both instances of it, and so is anything added
later. **This is the rule that was broken first.** `.dr-dialog` shipped with no
transition at all, so the disclaimer appeared instantly while the detail sheet
eight pixels away slid — two bottom-anchored surfaces, two different physics,
one of them obviously wrong. If you are writing a new surface and reaching for
a duration, you are already off the path: take the tokens.

On a phone the motion is a **pure slide**, no fade. A fade-and-lift is the
desktop gesture for a centered card; using it on something pinned to the bottom
edge is the same divergence one step smaller, which is why `.dr-dialog`'s
mobile block explicitly re-states `opacity: 1`.

### Animating a `<dialog>` — the part that silently half-works

```css
transition: transform var(--dr-dur-sheet) var(--dr-ease-sheet),
            overlay   var(--dr-dur-sheet) allow-discrete,
            display   var(--dr-dur-sheet) allow-discrete;
```

`allow-discrete` on `display` and `overlay` is not optional. A modal dialog
leaves the top layer the instant `close()` is called, so without it **the open
direction animates and the close direction does not** — and you will test the
open direction, see it work, and ship. `@starting-style` supplies the
from-state, because on open the element has no previous computed style to
animate from.

`getComputedStyle` cannot verify the closed state: a closed `<dialog>` is
`display: none` and its transform resolves to `none` whatever the rule says.
Assert the motion by sampling the element's position mid-flight instead.

## 3b. The sheet and its consumer have to agree

`.dr-sheet` wraps a panel the tool already owns, so there are two elements that
can disagree. Three ways they did:

- **Ground.** The sheet, its grip and the panel inside it are three elements
  painting what has to look like one surface, and each had its own idea of the
  color. Stacked, that put a band above the content and another below it,
  which read as a header and a footer the sheet does not have. The sheet
  exposes `--dr-sheet-surface` and the consumer sets it — never restyle
  `.dr-sheet` itself. **A detail panel's ground is `--panel`, not `--bg`**:
  it is a surface sitting on the page, not a piece of the page, and once it is
  white there is nothing left to override.
- **Padding at the bottom.** `padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom, 0px)`,
  not `max(1rem, env(…))`. The floor put 16px of bare surface under the
  scrolling body on every device without a home indicator, which is the footer
  band again. Padding the *content* is the consumer's job.
- **One scroller, and it is the panel itself.** `attach()` puts
  `.dr-sheet__body` on the host element. `#panel` *is* the body; there is no
  inner content box, so the two can never be nested scrollers. An earlier
  version of this section said to set `overflow: visible` on the panel below
  md, to stop a second scroller from swallowing a drag. **That advice was
  wrong and it shipped a bug.** `#panel` at 1-0-0 outranks
  `.dr-sheet__body { overflow-y: auto }` at 0-1-0, so the declaration removed
  the drawer's only scroller: nothing moved inside the sheet and the touch
  chained straight through to the page behind it. Drag-to-dismiss is bound to
  the grip alone, so content scrolling was never competing with it.
  **Declare no `overflow` on the panel below md** and let the desktop rule
  carry through. `test_noblogs_mobile.spec.js` asserts the computed value
  rather than a scroll position, because scrolling an element that cannot
  scroll is a silent no-op that reads as a pass — which is how this survived.
- **Close buttons.** `DRSheet` adds one; most panels already have their own.
  On a phone they stacked into two X's in two header bars. **The sheet's wins**
  (it is the one that also dismisses the sheet); hide the tool's own below md.
- **Room at the top.** `.dr-sheet__close` is a 44px target pinned to the
  top-right. The grip is the sheet's header row and **must be at least as tall**,
  or the close overhangs whatever the panel renders first and every consumer
  has to leave a hole in its own corner. Reserved once, in the component.

The general rule: when a shared wrapper and its consumer both have an opinion
about a surface, the wrapper exposes a variable and the consumer sets it. Two
stylesheets independently deciding what color something is will drift.

## 4. A control for a state that manages itself is not a control

The graph had a `‹` / `›` chevron floating over the canvas to collapse the
detail panel. But the panel is empty until you click a node and empties again
when you click the background — so the button's only honest use was hiding a
panel that already had something in it, and the same background click did that
*plus* the deselect you actually wanted.

Before adding a control, ask what state it manages and whether anything else
already manages it. If the answer is "the selection does", delete it.

### Express state with a setter, never a toggle-by-side-effect

Three call sites in the graph reached for `panelToggle.onclick()` — a **toggle**
— to mean "close" or "open" *specifically*. Each had to test the current state
first and skip the call if it was already right. Miss that guard and the call
does the exact opposite of what the call site wanted.

```js
// Wrong: every caller must know the current state to use it safely.
function togglePanel(){ el.classList.toggle('collapsed'); }
if (!el.classList.contains('collapsed')) togglePanel();   // "close"

// Right: idempotent, and the call site says what it means.
function setPanel(open){
  if (el.classList.contains('collapsed') === !open) return;
  el.classList.toggle('collapsed', !open);
  requestAnimationFrame(() => cy.resize());
}
setPanel(false);
```

---

## 5. Search is a control, not furniture

A search field parked on the canvas is a white box permanently covering data.
The graph's sat top-center over the densest part of the network **and**
duplicated the explorer's page-level field two rows above it.

Search opens from the toolbar:

The header field is the only field. noblogs' graph went through three canvas
searches — a 270px box parked top-center, one hidden behind a toolbar button,
one growing out of that button — before the answer turned out to be that a
canvas does not need one. If you are positioning a search over a visualization,
stop and ask what the header field is for.

**If a control cluster must hold an expanding field anyway** (a toolbar with no
header above it), two things: it expands out of its own button rather than
appearing beside it, and in a flex **column** the expanded part must not sit in
flow — the column's width is its widest child and `align-items: stretch` hands
that width to every sibling, so the field drags all the buttons wider with it.
- **Escape closes and clears**, and must `stopPropagation()` — the explorer
  listens for Escape on `document` to close its detail drawer, and dismissing a
  search should not also dismiss what you were reading.
- `[hidden]` needs saying explicitly in CSS when the element also has a
  `display` rule, or `display` wins over the UA's hidden.

A page-level search and a canvas-level search are different searches. If a tool
has both, one of them is wrong.

### On a network view, search FINDS. It does not filter.

One search field, in the header, and **what it does is the view's job, not the
field's**:

| view | the query | |
|---|---|---|
| map, list | **narrows** — feeds `filtered()` | the set is the point |
| graph | **finds** — highlights, frames, never removes | the *structure* is the point |

Filtering a network deletes the thing you opened it to look at. It is also
arithmetically hopeless: noblogs' graph holds **217 of 7,673** blogs, so a
corpus query lands in it by luck —

```
antifa     1,245 corpus →  108 nodes      berlin   349 →  7
anarchist  2,231       →   71             squat    758 →  9
adl            3       →    1             amnesty    9 →  1
```

— and the most natural query of all, naming an institution, **cannot work at
any scale**: the 77 institutions are nodes on the canvas, not rows in the blog
index. No filtering search will ever return one.

So `F.q` is view-dependent while the **facets are not**. The facets still
cross-filter every view (that contract is untouched); only the text query
changes meaning. Keep the two filter functions separate and named for it —
`filtered()` is facets AND query, `facetFiltered()` is facets alone.

Three things follow, and each one is a bug if you miss it:

- **Facet counts** must be scoped the same way the view is. Counting with the
  query applied, on a view where the query does not filter, makes the panel
  disagree with the canvas.
- **The status line** counts what the view can show — nodes here, not corpus
  rows. "1 of 7,673" describes a set the graph cannot display.
- **Switching views must re-render.** The line and the facet groups are both
  view-dependent now, so a switch that only toggles `display` leaves the
  previous view's numbers on screen.

Frame what you found: center a single hit, fit several, and **leave the camera
alone on zero** — moving the view to show an empty result is worse than not
moving it. A miss says so in the status line; it does not empty the canvas.

---

## 6. Measure one thing, and only what still moves

Canvases size against what is left of the viewport:

```css
height: calc(100dvh - var(--nb-stage-top,7rem) - var(--nav-clearance)
             - var(--nb-band-line) * 2);
```

Every literal in that expression is a bug waiting for a different screen, so
the offset is measured.

### A height is not a position, and this repo has paid for that four times

`--nb-stage-top` is the band's distance from the top of the **document**. It
was `--nb-header-h`, the tool header's height — and those two agree only when
the page is scrolled far enough for the header to be pinned at `top: 0`. On
arrival the band also has the site banner and the masthead above it, so it ran
~270px past the bottom of the window: you landed on a map you had to scroll to
see. dsa-explorer had the same bug with a literal `7rem` standing in for the
same distance.

Three rules fall out of it:

- **Measure the position when you mean the position.** The header's height is
  still the right number for the facet rail's sticky offset. It is never the
  right number for "how much room is left below this".
- **`offsetTop`, not `getBoundingClientRect().top`.** A sticky element's rect
  moves when it pins; `offsetTop` is the static layout position and does not.
  Sum it up the `offsetParent` chain.
- **Subtract the band's own border.** The height goes on the children and the
  1px rule is on the wrapper around them, so it is not in their box. Name the
  width once (`--nb-band-line`) and use it in both places, or the canvas is
  2px too tall and nobody ever works out why.

Keep a `min-height` floor. Below some window height a usable canvas matters
more than fitting, and that is a deliberate choice rather than an oversight.

Two things used to make this harder than it is, and the pattern removes both:

- a **separate filter bar** below the header — a second measured band. Filters
  is a control *inside* the header's controls row, so there is one band.
- a **disclaimer that changed the header's height when it opened** — the modal
  does not touch layout at all.

What is left is one `ResizeObserver` on one element. **Measure by id**
(`#nb-header`): the site masthead is also a `<header>` and comes first in the
DOM, so `querySelector('header')` returns the wrong element — a bug this repo
has already shipped twice.

---

## 7. Display options are not filters

A checkbox that changes *what is drawn over* the data is not a checkbox that
changes *which data exists*. Keep them apart:

| | Filter | Display option |
|---|---|---|
| state | the `F` set | its own variable |
| URL | yes | no |
| resets paging | yes | no |
| counts toward the Filters badge | **yes** | **no** |

A badge reading "1" when the only thing set is "edges are visible" is lying
about the result count.

Group display options under their own `<legend>` in the popover (`Map`), and
render the group **only on the view it applies to**.

### The panel's reset

`Clear all filters` is the panel's reset, so it sits at the **trailing edge**,
sentence case, and is **`disabled` when there is nothing to clear**. On the
leading edge it read as the first item of the first filter group; at full
strength with an empty set it was a control advertising work it cannot do.

Use `disabled`, not a faded class — the fade is the visible half of a state the
keyboard and the screen reader should also get.

### `hidden` and `display`, for the second time

A count badge that a tool toggles with `hidden` needs
`.dr-btn__count:not([hidden])` on its `display` rule. `hidden` only sets
`display: none` through the UA stylesheet, so a bare `display: inline-flex`
beats it and the badge shows "0" forever. **This repo has now paid for this
trap twice** — `.dr-sheet__scrim` carries the same note. Any rule that sets
`display` on an element something toggles with `hidden` has to say `:not([hidden])`.

### Reach into a module through an API, not its DOM

The co-citation toggle used to live in the card and `map.js` read
`edgeToggle.checked` live. Moving the checkbox into the filter popover would
have broken it silently — that popover rewrites its own `innerHTML` on every
facet change, so any element inside it is destroyed and recreated with no
listener attached.

The module owns the boolean and exposes `setEdges(on)`. The standalone page
still ships its own `#edgeToggle` and writes through the same variable.

**Corollary: never read data out of the DOM.** `CATCOLOR` was scraped from the
legend's inline swatch styles, on the argument that a second copy would be a
second thing to keep in step. Right about the risk, wrong about the direction:
it made a node that exists for *humans* into a data dependency, so deleting the
legend — the correct design change — would have blanked every facet swatch
instead of failing loudly. State it once in JS, next to a comment naming the
real authority (`map_data.js`).

---

## 8. Tooltips name what a mode does — and a toggle shows its value

Two different jobs, and a control that is ambiguous usually needs both.

### The tooltip is `data-tip`, never `title`

```html
<button data-tip-title="Re-layout" data-tip="Recompute where every node sits.
        Useful when labels overlap after a lot of panning.">
```

`assets/js/tooltip.js` + `components/tooltip.css`. **`title` was tried first and
is not good enough**: the native tooltip waits about a second, and on an
icon-only control that delay is the whole interaction — you hover a glyph you do
not recognize, get nothing, and move on. A tooltip that exists to explain an
ambiguous control has to be instant.

Three things about it that are not obvious:

- **It is appended to `<body>`, not next to its trigger.** Both canvases set
  `isolation: isolate` to contain Leaflet and Cytoscape, so a tip rendered
  inside one is trapped in that stacking context and clipped by `#stage`'s
  `overflow: hidden`. Out at body level it sits on the site's own scale.
- **It is delegated from `document`.** Both graph toolbars and all three
  legends rewrite their own markup at runtime; nothing has to re-bind.
- **Never both.** Leaving `title` on a tipped control stacks the native
  tooltip underneath ours a second later and reads the text twice to a screen
  reader. `tests/test_tooltip.spec.js` asserts the absence.

It is a *description*, so the trigger keeps its own accessible name and gets
`aria-describedby` only while the tip is up.

### Write the sentence for someone who has not used the tool

An icon can name a thing but cannot say whether a mode is on; a label can say
which mode it is but not **what it does**. Name the effect and the consequence,
not the mechanism:

| control | tooltip |
|---|---|
| Focus mode | "Clicking a node shows only that node and its direct ties, so you can follow the network one node at a time. Turn it off to keep the whole graph visible and select without fading the rest." |
| Target edges only | "Hide every citation except the ones backing a target designation — the red edges in the key." |
| Inferred links | "Show the dashed, inferred relationships as well as the solid confirmed ones. Inferred ties are analytical readings, not sourced facts." |
| Re-layout | "Recompute where every node sits. Useful when labels overlap after a lot of panning." |
| Reset view | "Back to where you started. In focus mode that is the center node's ring; otherwise the whole graph, fitted." |
| Export | "Download a high-resolution PNG of exactly this view — same pan, zoom and fade, at print quality." |
| Back (available) | "Go back to the node you were looking at before this one." |
| Back (unavailable) | "Goes back to the node you were looking at before this one. Turns on once you have opened a second node." |

**Plain American English, and no metaphor the tool does not draw.** These
sentences described "walking" the network one hop at a time — a picture the
tool never puts on screen, and a word that has to be decoded before the
sentence helps. You *open* a node and *follow* its ties.

Zoom in / Zoom out get two words. Do not write a sentence for a control nobody
has ever had to think about.

### A canvas toolbar is icon-only, and a toggle shows its state with a dot

```html
<button class="dr-btn dr-btn--icon" aria-pressed="true"
        aria-label="Focus mode" data-tip-title="Focus mode" data-tip="…">
  <svg …><span class="dr-btn__dot" aria-hidden="true"></span>
</button>
```

A labeled pill is the widest thing on the canvas, and a column of them reads
as a menu rather than as tools — it also covers the canvas, which §2 is about.
So **every control in a canvas toolbar is icon-only.** The name goes in
`aria-label` and in `data-tip-title`; the sentence explaining a mode goes in
`data-tip`, which is the one thing a label could never do anyway.

That leaves a toggle with nowhere to put a word, so the state is a dot in the
corner: **present means on, absent means off.** `aria-pressed` is the single
source — `.dr-btn__dot` is shown and hidden by CSS keyed on that attribute, so
there is nothing else to write and nothing that can disagree with it:

```js
function setToggle(btn, on){ btn.setAttribute('aria-pressed', String(on)); }
```

A dot cannot say *which* mode is on, so it only works where the icon already
carries the identity. For a toggle that does have a label — in a panel, in a
form — `.dr-btn__state` is the counterpart: an On/Off value in its own slot,
`min-width`ed so the two strings do not resize the button. Either way the
button's width must not change with its state, or the whole column shifts on
every click.

Only for a real two-state toggle. A button that *does* something — Reset view,
Export — has no state to show.

**The tooltip says the state in words, and DRTip writes it.** The dot is the
at-a-glance answer; the tip's title row carries `ON` / `OFF` opposite the name,
so hovering a mode you are unsure about tells you what it is set to as well as
what it does. Nothing is added to the markup for this — DRTip reads the
trigger's `aria-pressed`, so any control that is already a proper toggle gets
it, and no second attribute exists to drift. A control without `aria-pressed`
gets no chip, which is why plain actions stay plain. DRTip also re-renders the
tip when you click the control it is already describing, or a toggle would read
`ON` for as long as the pointer stayed put after switching it off.

### An unavailable control still has to explain itself

Use **`aria-disabled="true"`, not `disabled`**, on any icon-only control that
can be unavailable, and guard the handler yourself:

```js
backBtn.onclick = () => { if (!hist.length) return; … };
```

A browser dispatches **no pointer events at all** over a `disabled` element, so
its tooltip can never open — and an icon-only control that is grayed out with
no way to ask why is the worst case of the icon-only trade. It is also the
moment someone is most likely to want the explanation: the control is there,
it is clearly off, and nothing says what would turn it on. `.dr-btn:disabled`
keeps `pointer-events: none`; the `[aria-disabled]` rule deliberately does not.

Swap the sentence with the state, so the unavailable case says how to reach the
available one rather than describing something that is not happening:

```js
const BACK_TIP = {
  on:  'Go back to the node you were looking at before this one.',
  off: 'Goes back to the node you were looking at before this one. Turns on once you have opened a second node.'
};
```

`disabled` is still right for a control that is briefly inert because it is
*working* — Export during a render, where `aria-busy` is the state and there is
nothing to explain.

### Icons: pick the verb, not the category

`fit` was a four-corner "expand" glyph and `relayout` a circular arrow, which
are both generic enough to mean nothing in a toolbar that also has zoom. They
are **rewind** (go back to the start) and **shuffle** (rearrange) now. Ask what
the control *does* and find the glyph for that verb; if you cannot, the control
needs a word, not a better icon.

### Busy is an attribute, never a text swap

```js
b.textContent = 'Rendering…';   // deletes the <svg> child, permanently
```

The graph's Export button did this and lost its icon on the first export, for
the whole session — `textContent` replaces *every* child, and restoring the
string never brings the `<svg>` back. An icon-only button has no text to swap
anyway. Say it with attributes:

```js
b.disabled = true; b.setAttribute('aria-busy','true');
// …
b.disabled = false; b.removeAttribute('aria-busy');
```

`.dr-btn[aria-busy="true"]` is already styled, and `aria-busy` is what a screen
reader reads. If a control genuinely needs a word swapped, put the word in its
own element and swap that element's text — never the button's.

### The vendor's own controls get the same shape

Leaflet ships a joined, square, 26px `.leaflet-bar`. Beside a Cytoscape toolbar
of round `.dr-btn--icon` controls the two tools looked like two products, and
26px is well under the tap floor everything else clears.
`components/leaflet.css` restyles it — still Leaflet's control, still with its
own keyboard and disabled handling, only the shape is ours. Every selector in
that file is a class Leaflet writes at runtime, which is exactly why it has to
live outside `@layer`.

## 9. What the tests hold

Re-point a spec when a mechanism changes; do not delete it. The property is
usually still real and only the trigger moved.

| Spec | Property |
|---|---|
| `test_toolbars.spec.js` | every `#controls` button is a `.dr-btn`, named, tooltipped; 32px desktop / 44px phone; the legend never reaches the control column |
| `test_disclaimer.spec.js` | full text reachable without a pointer; never the smallest type; **and for the modal**: `:modal` (so `show()` can't creep in), focus returns to the opener, opening does not reflow the header |
| `test_review_regressions.spec.js` | `.collapsed` really moves the grid column — now driven by selecting a node; the search field boots hidden, opens beside the controls, and takes focus |
| `test_noblogs_mobile.spec.js` | `--nb-header-h` is the tool header's height and not the masthead's |
| `test_noblogs_sheet_chrome.spec.js` | the sheet, its grip and the panel are one surface; **and the sidebar**: in flow beside the canvas, never over it, never empty, and the band's outer corners are clipped |
| `test_map_legend.spec.js` | Category renders in both the sidebar and the popover, and neither holds state |

**When you add a control to a cluster, move the legend's height budget with
it.** `graph.css` reserves `calc(100% - 340px)` for eight 32px buttons plus gaps
and the inset. That number is derived from the thing directly above it in the
same box — which is what makes it stable, and what `calc(100vh - 150px)` never
was.

## Checklist for the next tool

- [ ] Three rows: identity + legal / views / subset. Phone stacks, md merges 2+3.
- [ ] Header is a flex column, not `flex-wrap`.
- [ ] Canvas has no permanent overlay. Vendor corners are clear.
- [ ] The detail is a column of the canvas, not a drawer over the page; it is
      never empty, the close only exists with a selection, and there is no
      scrim. A view with no canvas keeps the overlay.
- [ ] The canvas band is a closed box: 1px rule all the way around, rounded on
      its outer corners, `overflow: hidden`. The header draws no rule above it.
- [ ] A control drawn in two places holds no state: both rendered from the one
      source on every change, both bound by the same binder, and anything
      reading the DOM back names which container it means.
- [ ] Legal text is a `.dr-dialog`, opened with `showModal()`.
- [ ] Every sliding surface uses `--dr-dur-sheet` / `--dr-ease-sheet`; a
      `<dialog>` also needs `allow-discrete` + `@starting-style`.
- [ ] The sheet and its panel agree: `--dr-sheet-surface` set, the tool's own
      close hidden below md, nothing rendered under the 44px grip row.
- [ ] No control for a state the selection already manages.
- [ ] State setters are idempotent (`setX(bool)`), not toggles.
- [ ] One search field. On a network view it finds and frames; it never
      filters. Facet counts, the status line and view switches all follow.
- [ ] The panel reset is trailing-edge, sentence case, `disabled` when empty.
- [ ] Any `display` rule on a `hidden`-toggled element says `:not([hidden])`.
- [ ] One measured band, observed by id.
- [ ] Display options separate from filters; out of the badge and the URL.
- [ ] Cross-module state goes through an API; no data scraped from the DOM.
- [ ] `data-tip` on every toolbar control (never `title`); a sentence for
      anything ambiguous, written for someone who has not used the tool.
- [ ] Every canvas control is icon-only, with `aria-label` + `data-tip-title`
      for the name and `data-tip` for the sentence. Rounded rectangle, one
      token (`--dr-radius-control`) shared with the vendor's own controls.
- [ ] A canvas toggle's state is a `.dr-btn__dot`, driven by `aria-pressed`
      alone; a labeled toggle uses `.dr-btn__state`. Either way the button's
      width does not change with its state.
- [ ] Busy is `aria-busy` + `disabled`, never a `textContent` swap.
- [ ] The band's height comes from its own distance to the top of the
      document, measured with `offsetTop`, minus the band's border. Never from
      a header's height.
- [ ] One `.dr-wordmark`; a masthead variant is which tag, never which type.
