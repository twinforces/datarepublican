# Contracts a refactor must not break

Every entry here is load-bearing and non-obvious. Most encode a bug that was
already fixed once.

## `window.DRSheet` — `assets/js/sheet.js`

The shared bottom sheet. **Two consumers**: `noblogs/index.html` and
`dsa-explorer/index.html`. Do not replace it with a dialog machine.

```js
DRSheet = { attach(el, {label, detent, onClose}) -> handle, isMobile(), DETENTS }
handle  = { el, open(detent?), close(), isOpen(), setDetent(d), isMobile() }
DETENTS = { peek: 0.32, half: 0.55, full: 0.92 }   // fractions of innerHeight
```

**Three things the consumer owes the sheet.** It wraps a panel the tool already
styles, so both have an opinion and they have to agree:

| | |
|---|---|
| **ground** | set `--dr-sheet-surface` on the wrapper if the panel is not white. noblogs' `#panel` is the page ground; the mismatch painted white bands above and below the content that read as a header and footer the sheet does not have. Never restyle `.dr-sheet` directly |
| **close** | the sheet adds one. Hide the tool's own below md, or the panel gets two X's in two header bars |
| **top** | `.dr-sheet__grip` is the header row and is `min-height: var(--dr-tap)` so the 44px close fits inside it. Do not render anything into the sheet's top-right corner expecting it to be free |

**Motion is `--dr-dur-sheet` / `--dr-ease-sheet`.** One bottom-sheet motion on
this site; `.dr-dialog` uses the same two tokens. A new sliding surface takes
them rather than picking a duration.

**It wraps, it does not nest — and the host element becomes the body.**
`attach()` inserts a `div.dr-sheet` *around* the host element and then adds
`.dr-sheet__body` to the host itself (`sheet.js`). It never creates an inner
content box. Both tools do `panel.innerHTML = …` on every interaction, so
anything inserted as a child is destroyed on the first tap. The grip and close
button live in the wrapper for this reason.

The consequence has cost a bug: `#panel` and `.dr-sheet__body` are the same
element, so a tool's id selector (1-0-0) beats every `.dr-sheet__body` rule
(0-1-0). An `overflow` declared on the panel does not hand scrolling to an
inner box — it *replaces* the sheet's only scroller. Consumers declare none
below md. See §3b of `tool-chrome.md`.

**`display: contents` is load-bearing.** At desktop the wrapper vanishes from
layout so `#panel` stays a direct grid child. `test_dsa_explorer_mobile.spec.js`
asserts the panel is the right-hand column at 1280px. Portalling breaks both the
test and the layout.

**`lastFocused` is captured only on the first open of a run.** dsa-explorer calls
`open()` on *every* node tap; re-capturing made `close()` restore focus to a
closed sheet. There is a comment in the file about it. Any rewrite that re-runs
focus capture per `open()` reintroduces that bug.

**Drag thresholds**, grip-only, Pointer Events: `dy > 120` steps down a detent or
closes from `peek`; `dy < -80` steps up; upward drag is rubber-banded `dy/3`.
Asymmetric on purpose. No velocity detection — a fast short flick will not close.

**noblogs drives it indirectly**: a `MutationObserver` on `#panel`'s class mirrors
the tool's own `.on` onto `sheet.open()` / `sheet.close()`. Calling the sheet
directly is the improvement, but `openModal`/`closeModal` must stay the single
entry point either way.

### `onClose` is not a deselect hook

**The sheet is a view of the selection, not the selection itself.** Dismissing it
must leave the underlying visualization exactly as it was — same fade, same
selected element, same camera.

dsa-explorer got this wrong and it shipped. Its `onClose` ran
`cy.elements().removeClass('faded nbr sel')`, which is the focus-OFF branch of
its background-tap handler, applied unconditionally — including in focus mode,
which is the default. So on a phone you tapped a node to read it, and closing
what you were reading snapped the whole network back to full strength and lost
your place in the graph.

Two things to take from it:

- The tool's real deselect gesture was **conditional** (focus mode re-applies the
  ring; only focus-off clears) and the close handler borrowed one branch of it.
  If you find yourself copying a line out of another handler into `onClose`, that
  is the smell.
- "Restoring" state on close is also wrong when restoring **moves** something.
  `applyFocus()` animates the camera over 420ms, so re-applying it on dismiss
  would shift the view the user had just positioned.

noblogs is fine: its `onClose` calls `closeModal()`, which only clears its own
`.on` classes and `SEL`, and touches neither the map nor the graph.

Test a dismissal by **both** paths. The close button and a swipe are different
code paths, and a swipe from `half` steps to `peek` rather than closing — a
single drag never reaches `close()` at all.

## noblogs view tabs

`noblogs/index.html` calls `document.querySelector('.tab[data-v="…"]').click()`
internally in two places, and `test_noblogs_mobile.spec.js` clicks
`.tab[data-v="map"]` directly. The tablist is hand-built — `role="tablist"`,
roving tabindex, arrows/Home/End, `aria-selected`, `aria-controls` — and the
keyboard handler ends in `next.focus(); next.click()` precisely so the click path
stays the single way a view changes. **Anything that reworks the tabs must leave
`.click()` working**, or both internal callers and the spec break at once.

## `NBMap` — `noblogs/map.js`

```js
NBMap.init(el, {standalone, legendScope, onOpenHost}) -> api
api = { map, markers, setHosts(hosts) -> shownCount, setEdges(on), focus(host), invalidateSize(), destroy() }
```

**Two consumers with different chrome.** `noblogs/index.html` has no legend and
no `#edgeToggle`; `noblogs/world_hyperlocal_map.html` still ships both. The
module therefore owns edge visibility as a variable and exposes `setEdges()` —
it must never go back to reading `edgeToggle.checked` live. The explorer's copy
of that control lives in the filter popover, and `buildFacets()` rewrites that
subtree wholesale on every change, so any element inside it is destroyed and
recreated with no listener attached.

**`setHosts` returns the number of pins actually placed**, which is not the
number of blogs that matched — a blog with no resolvable city has no
coordinates. The explorer's status line uses that return value. Do not discard
it.

`legendCats` and the `.lgrow` click wiring are live code, not dead: the
standalone page depends on them.

## noblogs cross-filter

`filtered()` feeds three consumers at once — the card grid, the map's `setHosts`,
and the graph's host set. A facet toggled anywhere must still filter all three.
This is the single most valuable behavior not to break, and it is what made the
unreachable Filters button a real bug rather than a cosmetic one.

## Ids the specs assert

`#nb-header` (sticky), `#panel`, `#gpanel`, `#legToggle` (visible, ≥44px),
`#legend .legchips` (hidden → visible), `#mapcanvas`, `#maploading`,
`header.page-column` (must stay `position: static`). Preserve them through any
restructure.

## Test expectations that encode product decisions

- `test_noblogs_mobile.spec.js` — landing view is the **map**; a `?view=dash`
  deep link must not fetch `map_data.js`, `/map.js` or leaflet.
- Ten `.card` waits use `state: 'attached'` because the landing view hides
  `#dashview`. The three that ask for `visible` navigate to `?view=dash`.
- `test_review_regressions.spec.js` — the masthead stays a plain static block on
  `/`, `/noblogs/`, `/dsa-explorer/`, `/browse/`, `/about/`; the shell measure
  follows the viewport (1280 → 1280, 1500 → 1400, 1600 → 1600, 2000 → 1600).

## Payload figures, correctly stated

Over the wire, gzipped: `data.index.json` **3.1 MB** (fetched on every view,
unconditionally), `data.detail.json` **2.3 MB** (prefetched after paint),
`map_data.js` **0.8 MB** (on Map activation). The uncompressed 3.68 MB figure for
`map_data.js` appears in older comments and overstates the cost by ~4×.
